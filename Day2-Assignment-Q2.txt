2.write the difference between var, let and const with example.

Ans

var: The scope of a variable defined here is limited to the function within which it is defined.
var is function scoped.
ex:
      var greet = "hello";
      document.write(greet);
      output:
	hello

let: The scope of a variable defined with let is limited to the block.
It is block-scoped.
        document.write(x);
        let x = 10;
        output:
	error. undefined.
        

const:The scope of a variable defined here is limited to the block. It cannot be re-assigned to a new value. However it can be mutated.
	ex:
	const PI = 3.14159265359;
